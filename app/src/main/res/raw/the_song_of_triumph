1 When we meet together on the other shore,
When the journey’s cares and its dangers shall be o’er;
When our eyes behold our Savior, Lord and King—
What a song of triumph we shall sing!

Refrain:
There’s a song everybody will sing,
One of praise unto Jesus the King!
With the ransomed host of Zion at Life’s eternal spring,
What a song of triumph we shall sing!

2 Of His mercy shall our grateful anthem roll,
On reunion day in the homeland of the soul;
Heaven’s mighty arches with melody shall ring—
What a song of triumph we shall sing! [Refrain]

3 When at last we know Him and His name shall own,
When His kingdom cometh and He is on His throne,
When the living treasures for His crown we bring—
What a song of triumph we shall sing!
