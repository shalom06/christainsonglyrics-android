1 A babe lies in the cradle,
A little babe so dear,
With noble light he shineth
As shines a mirror clear,
This little babe so dear.

2 The babe within the cradle
Is Jesus Christ our Lord;
To us all peace and amity
At this good time afford
Thou Jesus Christ our Lord.

3 Whoso would rock the cradle
Where lies the gentle child,
A lowly heart must lead him,
By passions undefiled,
As Mary pure and mild.

4 O Jesu, babe belov√®d!
O Jesu, babe divine!
How mighty is thy wondrous love!
Fill thou this heart of mine
With that great love of thine.
