1 A baby once slept in a manger,
A mother sat close by His side;
This babe was the Little Lord Jesus
Who for our sins suffered and died.

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus,
Born this blessed morning,
Hail Him! hail Him!
On this Christmas day.

2 Wise men sought this little Lord Jesus
Who lived on the earth long ago,
They came with their beautiful treasures
To Bethlehem’s plain through the snow. [Refrain]

3 Now if we will seek this Lord Jesus
He’ll fill all our hearts with His love;
And gently His spirit will guide us
To beautiful mansions above.
